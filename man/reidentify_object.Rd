\item{beh}{lowercase string corresponding to the behavior term}

\item{obj}{lowercase string corresponding to the object identity}

\item{dictionary}{which dictionary to use, currently set to "us"}

us 1978 equations, or "user supplied")}

\item{eq_df}{if you select "user supplied" for equation, this parameter should
be your equation dataframe, which (should have been reshaped by the
reshape_new_equation function prior)}
