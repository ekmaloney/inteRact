\title{Compute Deflection for an Event}
\usage{
get_deflection(df, equation_info, eq_df = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{eq_df}{if you select "user supplied" for equation, this parameter should
be your equation dataframe, which (should have been reshaped by the
reshape_new_equation function prior)}

\item{act}{lowercase string corresponding to the actor identity}

\item{beh}{lowercase string corresponding to the behavior term}

\item{obj}{lowercase string corresponding to the object identity}

\item{dictionary_key}{a string corresponding to the dictionary from actdata you are using for cultural EPA measurements}

\item{gender}{either average, male, or female, depending on if you are using gendered equations}

\item{equation_key}{a string corresponding to the equation key from actdata}
}
\value{
calculated deflection for the event (single number)
}
\description{
This function calculates the deflection for an Actor, Behavior, Object event.
It assumes that the first input is an identity corresponding to the actor,
the second, the behavior, and last, the object. Each of these terms must be
in the US 2015 dictionary.
}
\examples{
d <- tibble::tibble(actor = "ceo", behavior = "advise", object = "benefactor")
d <- reshape_events_df(df = d, df_format = "wide", dictionary_key = "usfullsurveyor2015", dictionary_gender = "average")
get_deflection(df = d, equation_info = "us2010_average")
}
