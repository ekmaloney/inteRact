\title{Compute Element Deflection for an Event}
\usage{
element_deflection(df, equation_info)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{data that has been reshaped by the events_df}

\item{equation_info}{is a string that corresponds to "{equationkey}_{gender}"
from actdata}
}
\value{
dataframe in long format, with one row for each element-dimension of
the event, columns for fundamental sentiment and transient impression, the
difference between the fundamental sentiment and the transient impression
(difference) and the squared difference, the element's contribution to
deflection.
}
\description{
This function calculates the deflection for an Actor, Behavior, Object event.
It assumes that the first input is an identity corresponding to the actor,
the second, the behavior, and last, the object. Each of these terms must be
in the US 2015 dictionary.
}
\examples{

d <- tibble::tibble(actor = "ceo", behavior = "advise", object = "benefactor")
d <- reshape_events_df(df = d, df_format = "wide",
dictionary_key = "usfullsurveyor2015", dictionary_gender = "average")
element_deflection(df = d, equation_info = "us2010_average")
}
